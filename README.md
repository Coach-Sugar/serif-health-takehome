# Serif Health Takehome Interview

This repository contains the files and instructions for our takehome engineering interview. Please *locally* copy to your own public repo or [import](https://github.com/new/import) to your github account for use in sharing solutions back to us. Direct public forks and pull requests will expose your identity and solution to other candidates also working on this interview question, and we want the interview process to be fair for everyone. 

## Context
One of the challenging problems we're solving at Serif Health is making healthcare pricing data transparent and uniform for all market participants. There are several reasons this is difficult.

At the macro level:
- Data in healthcare is sensitive by default and tends to be locked up in proprietary systems or data formats.
- The data aggregators and clearinghouses that do have access to clean, normalized bulk data assets tend to employ extremely expensive and restrictive licensing terms. 
- Recent price transparency laws have required hospitals to publish their pricing, data sharing occurs at varying levels of completeness and consistency, and hospitals are only a fraction of the overall healthcare market.  

At the micro level:
- Medical billing and coding for a specific procedures can very complicated and is contingent on place of service, comorbidities, and structure of insurance arrangements. 
- Insurance companies (payers) establish pre-negotiated contracted rates with each facility, physician group, or health system that reimburses the healthcare provider at a rate very different from what is 'charged'. 

Summed together, all this complexity contributes to a general lack of transparency and market efficency in the US healthcare system.


## Objective
Our customers typically want to know and compare reimbursement rates for healthcare services from specific payers. The objective for this takehome is to write a script that can take the data from a typical hospital price transparency file, parse it, and transform it to a normalized format we can ingest and leverage in our data warehouse for aggregation, search, and display. 


## Input
The input to this takehome are two JSON format hospital price files from different healthcare systems. A typical 'price' entity in these files consists of a procedure name, procedure code, procedure code type, gross charge (what is billed to the payer), and reimbursement rate (what is actually paid under the contracted rate).

https://www.adventhealth.com/sites/default/files/CDM/2022/480637331_AdventHealthShawneeMission_standardcharges.json

The code you need to write should be a script that can read in these two files (it's ok to copy them locally) and turn it into the requested output format below. 

## Output
Your output should be two CSV files, one per input file, with the following headers:
'Procedure Code, Procedure Code Type, Procedure Name, Gross Charge, Insurance Payer Name, Insurance Rate'

You should extract as many 'price' rows as you can without duplicating entries and without copying over empty data fields (denoted by N/A, empty strings, or missing keys). 

For simplicity's sake we are ignoring modifiers, patient tiers, insurance payer classes, facility type and other vagaries of the healthcare billing and coding world. We can discuss these in a followup call.


## Expectations
### Deliverable
You should send us a link to a public repository or zip file that contains at minimum:
1. The script used to parse the file and produce output. 
2. The setup or packaging file(s) required to recreate and execute your solution code
3. The two CSV output files generated by your code
4. A readme, explaining your solution and the tradeoffs you made along the way. 

### Langugage Choice
You can choose any language you want, but your solution should be portable enough to run on someone else's machine. 

### Dependencies
You *should* use dependencies (JSON parsers, data formatters, etc) and libraries from public package managers in your language of choice. Again, your solution should be portable enough to run on someone else's machine, so if you do this please make sure relevant setup instructions to execute the solution. 

### Time vs Quality
We are a small engineering team with limited resources, and often have to make hard tradeoffs to meet deadlines and make rapid forward progress. Please timebox your solution to two hours max - you have the opportunity to discuss the tradeoffs when submitting your solution. Experienced engineers should be able to complete the coding portion in less than an hour.
